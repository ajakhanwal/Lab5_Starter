1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.
   
   Answer: No, I wouldn't use a unit test to test it. Unit tests are designed to test individual units of code in isolation as mentioned above. Testing the "message" feature typically involves multiple components interacting with each other and thus, unit tests would not properly cover these interactions.

3) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.

   Answer: Yes, I would use a unit test to test it. This feature likely involves a specific function  that checks the length of the message for the maximum limit. Unit tests can effectively test this function in isolation as it is small scaled.
